### Introduction

Afghanistan. The graveyard of empires. And the birthplace of one of the most infamous organisations in recent history: the Taliban. Motivated by the suffering of the Afghan people, the Islamic fundamentalist, Pashtun nationalist, militant political movement was born in 1994. Founded by **Mullah Mohammad Omar** after leaving the Sang-i-Hisar Madrassa in Maiwand with just 50 students, they managed to grow to over 15,000 with the addition of students from Pakistani madrassas in just months - in fact, the word Taliban is Pashto for “students” (the singular being talib). With the recruits from Pakistan came financial and military support from the country, slowly developing the group into a proxy force for Pakistani interests in the region.

They committed their first attack on **November 3, 1994**, taking control of Kandahar City in a surprise attack, losing only a dozen men in the fight. By eradicating corruption, curbing lawlessness and making controlled areas a haven for commerce, they quickly gained popularity. Over the next 2 months, the Taliban took control of 12 provinces and by **February 1995**, it had grown to 25,000 fighters - a formidable force with experience, considering many of their numbers were former Mujahedeen.

On **26 September 1996**, Kabul was flooded by the Taliban and came under their control, establishing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan with the goal of establishing an Islamic government with a strict interpretation of Sharia law, in accordance with the Hanafi school of Fiqh (Islamic law) and the religious edicts of their founder, Mullah Omar. By 1998 the Emirate controlled nearly 90% of Afghanistan but 2001 brought ill fortune for the Taliban with the invasion of the US, its allies, and the Afghan Northern Alliance - forcing the leadership to flee to Pakistan.

Amidst the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan from 2020 to 2021, the Taliban launched a major offensive, securing half of Afghanistan’s ~400 districts by late July 2021[^2] rocketing them to the forefront of global news; cementing the return of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Despite assurances to the international community that the current Taliban are different from their predecessors, they appear to be slipping into their old ways, but only time will tell whether they have truly grown from their brutal past.

### History

Understanding the history of the Taliban requires us to dive into the history, and the geography to an extent, of Afghanistan itself. Taking a look at its position on the map, we begin to understand the strategic importance of the land that served as the centre of the ancient Silk Roads; acting as a gateway to the Indian subcontinent, and connecting China to western Asia and Europe, Afghanistan is where trade routes across Eurasia converged. With such a crucial position, it is crystal clear why so many wished to conquer this land. This unique gateway position is what piqued British interests in the 19th century, as they sought to protect the Crown Jewel of their empire - India - from potential Russian expansion. Seeing annexation as the only possible option, thus began the Anglo-Afghan wars which failed to achieve the British goal (thanks to an army exhausted by WWI), instead creating the independent nation of Afghanistan.

Despite the history of conflict in the region, it is during the Cold War period that the events which have greatly influenced modern Afghanistan and shaped the Taliban transpired. In 1953, the roots for Soviet-Afghan cooperation were laid by then-Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan who was forced to resign in 1963 following an economic crisis stemming from disputes with Pakistan. Post his resignation, the king (his cousin) Zahir Shah played a more active role, putting into effect a liberal constitution in 1964. Although the reforms from his experimentation were not all long-lasting they allowed the growth of both left and right parties like the communist People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). 

From here on, the history becomes more turbulent; in **1973, Daoud Khan** seized power in a non-violent coup, abolished the monarchy, abrogated the 1964 constitution and declared himself the first President and Prime Minister of the new republic of Afghanistan. His success was short-lived as his attempts at social and economic reforms failed, and his brutal government was overthrown on **28 April 1978**, by the Khalq faction of the PDPA, following which he and his family were assassinated in a bloody military coup that came to be known as the Saur revolution. At this point it is important to note the practice of **‘bi-tarafi’** that had become a tenet of foreign policy in the early ‘70s: army officers who had been to the US and the USSR for training programs arrived overwhelmingly at one conclusion - Afghanistan should remain independent. With the changes in the Middle East in the late ‘60s and the rise of anti-western sentiment, the USSR had followed a consistent course of expanding its political and military influence, a strategy that mirrored that of Washington post WWII - a strategy that Afghanistan was now a part of. Once in power, the PDPA, went about implementing Marxist-Leninist [^3] principles in governance, replacing traditional and religious laws. They also invited the Soviet Union for their assistance in modernising Afghanistan’s economic infrastructure, to which the USSR responded positively, dispatching contractors to build crucial infrastructure like roads, schools, hospitals, and to train and equip the Afghan Armed Forces. In total, the USSR promised monetary aid to the tune of ***$1.2bn***. But the brutal and ruthless nature of the PDPA government and their hardline stance against religion made them extremely unpopular amongst the populace, uniting traditionalists, landlords, tribal leaders and mullahs who revolted in 1979. The USSR sided with the ruling government, dispatching grain and food and waiving interest payments for outstanding loans, as well as providing military equipment. The level of Soviet involvement worried the US, who were considering future repercussions of Soviet actions in the situation. The murder of the US ambassador to Kabul in **1979** forced the US to engage more directly with the conflict in Afghanistan, cutting off any aid it had been sending, and providing support to anti-Communists and others who opposed the new government - a move that completely lacked foresight, as these were the same groups who opposed **all** Western meddling in Afghanistan. While the price of this deal, and supporting Islamists was not readily apparent, it would hit the world like a truck with the emergence of terror groups, decades down the line.

With increased military preparedness from the Soviet side in the later half of 1979, apparently ready for an intervention, tensions were high in Washington. But tensions in Moscow were even higher when Hafizullah Amin seized power, as the Soviets felt threatened by the prospect that Amin being friendly with the US would mean that America could point a dagger right at the heart of the Soviet Union (since the southern frontier of the USSR lacked a comprehensive air-defence system). The only solution in their eyes? A full blown invasion of Afghanistan, or in their words, “an attempt to restore stability”. Washington had been dealt a terrible hand. On one hand they were managing the crisis in Iran (that they were mostly responsible for), and now they had to face their worst fear. America’s solution? Support those opposing the invasion, the ‘Mujahedeen’, by providing them with weapons supplied by the CIA through Pakistan. **It was the birth of terrorism as we know it today in the view of many**. In addition to the money and weapons that flowed from the US, money came in from Saudi Arabia in support of the Mujahedeen - a result of Saudi sympathy for the Islamic militant rhetoric the resistance employed. Another unlikely ally of the anti-Soviet resistance was Beijing. Afghanistan had become the USSR’s Vietnam. The effects of supplying so much weaponry, training and money throughout the ‘80s to the resistance would become apparent soon, as former Mujahedeen soldiers became part of the Taliban. After seizing Kabul in 1996 and after attacks masterminded by Osama bin Laden in 1992 and 1993, and the al-Qaida bombings of US embassies in 1998, the US had come to realise their folly in so readily supplying weapons to militants whose only goal was to oppose foreign intervention in their conflict-riddled country. After President Bush’s retaliation, relations with the Taliban soured and the Taliban sided al-Qaida and bin Laden. The common sentiment in the Arab world at the time was that US policies propped up corrupt regimes designed to divide and weaken the Arab world. Post 9/11, the US took a harsher stance on terror in Afghanistan and Pakistan, which resulted in the protracted and somewhat successful War on Terror. Now we have successfully understood the historical conditions that resulted in the formation of the Taliban, and managed to gain an understanding of general sentiment at the time among Afghans. 

An analysis of the Taliban with this historical context establishes them as a group who want to reject undue Western influence in their country, albeit through extreme means. Given the brutality of the US and the USSR, the Taliban’s use of force is contextually vindicated. A fire must be fought with fire after all. So then why are they classified as a terror group?

### The Taliban and Terror:

While many members had previous experience as Mujahedeen, the creation of the Taliban itself was quite influenced by the ISI, the Pakistani intelligence agency, to further Pakistan’s strategic goals [^4].
The Taliban is responsible for numerous terror attacks, both inside and outside Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to UN officials, in the Taliban’s attempt to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, there had been "15 massacres" between 1996 and 2001. In 1998, the United Nations accused the Taliban of denying emergency food by the UN's World Food Programme to 160,000 hungry and starving people "for political and military reasons"[^5]. Once again, in 1998, they ethnically cleansed Mazar-i-Sharif, resulting in 5000 - 6000 dead. The tale of the Taliban’s attempts to secure control over Afghanistan are blotted with numerous brutal and deadly attacks against civilians, forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes, and wanton destruction - so many stories that they cannot be detailed in this article.
In 2011 alone, they killed former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, the police chief in northern Afghanistan, the commander of the elite anti-Taliban 303 Pamir Corps, Mohammad Daud Daud, and the police chief of Kunduz, Abdul Rahman Saidkhaili, all notable anti-Taliban leaders. In fact, the US Department of Defense believes that the Taliban may have a 40-man undercover unit dedicated for targeted killings[^6].
